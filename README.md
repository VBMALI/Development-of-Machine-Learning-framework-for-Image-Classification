# Development-of-Machine-Learning-algorithm-for-Image-Classification
- This project aims at developing a machine learning framework to perform image classification
- The image classification is performed in three ways - by implementation of K-Nearest neighbor classifier, using Naive-Bayes classifier and logistic regression.
- The image classification is performed on MNIST data set of hand written digits. The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
